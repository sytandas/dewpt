Dew point is essentially how much moisture is actually in the air. 
We can calculate it by using Magnus-Tetens formula.
The Magnus approximation is used to estimate the dew point:
$$
T_d = \frac{b\gamma(T,RH)}{a-\gamma(T,RH)}
$$

where

$$
\gamma(T,RH) = \frac{aT}{b+T} + \ln\left(\frac{RH}{100}\right)
$$

**Constants:**
- $a = 17.27$
- $b = 237.7$
- $T$ = temperature (°C)
- $RH$ = relative humidity (%)
- $T_d$ = dew point (°C)

Not 100% relection but fair bit of information to justify use to calculate running exertion.
e.g. 
13/06/2026, 5.30 Panskura, WB, India:
27 + 100% = 27 degree dew point ~ felt hard for amateur.
13/06/2026, 15:13 Nakano, Japan:
28 + 52% = 17.2 degree celsius ~ "too hot to run"- according to elite.

| Dew Point  | Running Conditions | Effect                    |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Below 10°C | Very dry           | Excellent for racing      |
| 10–13°C    | Comfortable        | Minimal impact            |
| 13–16°C    | Slight humidity    | Small increase in effort  |
| 16–18°C    | Noticeable         | Pace may slow slightly    |
| 18–21°C    | Uncomfortable      | Moderate performance loss |
| 21–24°C    | Very humid         | Significant slowdown      |
| Above 24°C | Oppressive         | High heat stress risk     |

TODO: 
1. Current weither integration with particular day and according exertion, maybe with strava.
